Build a Find the Number Game (Between 0 to 100)

Generate a random number between 1-100. Take input from user, check input is valid or not.

Compare input and give an output. Input is less or high then your generated number.

If it is equal terminate the app and congrats user.  I try to improve coding skills within HTML & CSS & JS
